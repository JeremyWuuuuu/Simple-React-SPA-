##
this is the frontend of my blog page

First, thank you for being here.

This whole page was based on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [React-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) 
and Also [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). 

I used the [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator to generate the initial configuration for me.
Here is how you use it:
```
  1.cd to your work directory && git clone https://github.com/JeremyWuuuuu/Simple-React-SPA-.git

  2.npm install 

  3.npm start 
```
Now you see the magic

One thing for sure is that there will always have troubles. So if you find out any bugs, please submit an issue. Maybe I can help with that. Thanks a lot.
