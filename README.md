#Simple-React-SPA

###New Feature
**11/11/2016** <br/><br/>
add both `previous & next button` in the blog page <br/>
add `MarkDown parser` now supporting markdown grammar

##
this is the frontend of my blog page

Firstly, thank you for being here.

This whole page was based on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [React-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) 
and Also [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). 

I used the [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator to generate the initial configuration for me.
Here is how you use it:
```
  1.cd your work directory && git clone //this respository

  2.npm install 

  3.npm start 
```
Now you see the magic

One thing for sure, that there is always going to have troubles, so, if you find out that there is any bug, plz pull an issue, and maybe I can help with that. Thanks a lot.
